# Contact Type Field Population Fix

## Problem
When editing a contact, the type dropdown fields for phone numbers, emails, and URLs were not being populated correctly. They would default to "Other" instead of showing the actual type (work, home, mobile, etc.).

## Root Cause
The `populateMultiFieldData` method in `ContactUIController.js` was trying to set dropdown values directly without normalizing the vCard types to match the available dropdown options.

For example:
- vCard might contain `TYPE=cell` but dropdown only has `mobile`
- vCard might contain `TYPE=internet` but dropdown only has `personal` and `other`

## Solution
Added a `normalizeFieldType` method that maps vCard property types to the available dropdown options:

### Phone Type Mappings:
- `work` → `work`
- `home` → `home`
- `mobile` → `mobile`
- `cell` → `mobile` (mapped)
- `fax` → `fax`
- `voice` → `other` (mapped)
- `text` → `other` (mapped)
- `pager` → `other` (mapped)

### Email Type Mappings:
- `work` → `work`
- `home` → `home`
- `personal` → `personal`
- `internet` → `other` (mapped)

### URL Type Mappings:
- `work` → `work`
- `home` → `home`
- `personal` → `personal`
- `blog` → `blog`

## Files Modified
- `src/ui/ContactUIController.js`
  - Updated `populateMultiFieldData` method
  - Added `normalizeFieldType` method

## Testing
- Created test file `test-edit-contact-types.html` for manual testing
- All type mappings tested and verified
- Case-insensitive matching implemented
- Proper fallback to "other" for unknown types

## Result
✅ Contact type fields now populate correctly when editing contacts
✅ RFC 9553 vCard types are properly mapped to UI options
✅ Primary/preferred flags are preserved
✅ All contact data is maintained during edit operations
