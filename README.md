# Contact Management System

**Status:** ðŸš§ In development!  
This project is not production-ready. Features, structure, and documentation are subject to rapid change.

## Overview

- Your contacts are broken ðŸ¤¯
- You have 200 contacts. When you change your number, 200 people then might have the wrong one.
- What if YOUR contact card updated itself in everyone's phone?
- That's what we built âœ¨
- Never text the wrong number again.
- Try  â†’ [it here](https://e2econtacts.org)
