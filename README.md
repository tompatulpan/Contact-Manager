# Contact Management System

**Status:** ðŸš§ Very much in development!  
This project is not production-ready. Features, structure, and documentation are subject to rapid change.

## Overview

- Your contacts are broken ðŸ¤¯
- You have 500 contacts. When you change your number, 500 people have the wrong one.
- What if YOUR contact card updated itself in everyone's phone?
- That's what we built âœ¨
- Never text the wrong number again.
- Try  â†’ https://e2econtacts.org

A secure, modular contact management system with:
- **End-to-end encrypted storage** (userbase.com)
- **Real-time sharing and sync**
- **Full RFC 9553 (vCard 4.0) compliance**
- **Distribution lists for group sharing**
- **Cross-device support** (web application)

## Key Features

- Create, edit, and organize contacts (vCard 4.0)
- Share contacts with users or groups (distribution lists)
- Archive, delete, and manage received/shared contacts
- Import/export contacts (vCard, QR code)
- Real-time updates and cross-device sync
