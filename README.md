# Contact Management System

**Status:** ðŸš§ Very much in development!  
This project is not production-ready. Features, structure, and documentation are subject to rapid change.

## Overview

- Your contacts are broken ðŸ¤¯
- You have 500 contacts. When you change your number, 500 people have the wrong one.
- What if YOUR contact card updated itself in everyone's phone?
- That's what we built âœ¨
- Never text the wrong number again.
- Try  â†’ https://e2econtacts.org
